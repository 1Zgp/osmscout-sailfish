This document list the files that are processed as part of an import.
For each file its content is described. Later version of this document
should also describe the internal format of each of these files. The
text in the brackets after the files name give information if this file
is required during import only ("import only") or are also part of the
official export data ("export").


rawnodes.dat (import only):
 * Raw dump of all nodes in import data

rawnode.idx (import only):
 * Index by numeric id over all nodes in 'rawnodes.dat'. Required
   for resolving nodes during way/area and relation preprocessing.

rawways.dat (import only):
 * Raw dump of all ways and areas in import data

rawway.idx (import only):
 * Index by numeric id over all ways/areas in 'rawways.dat'.
   Required for resolving nodes during relation preprocessing.

rawrels.dat (import only):
 * Raw dump of all relations in import data

nodeuse.idx (import only):
* index of nodes that areapart of a way/area. Influences
  drawing of way ends.

wayblack.dat (import only):
 * List of way ids that are already part of a outer member
   of a multipolygon region. This ids will not be part of
   area.idx, because they would then be drawn twice. Once as way
   and once as part of the relation.

types.dat (export):
 * Mapping of internal type ids to type names
 * Mapping of internal tag ids to tag names

bounding.dat(export):
 * Holds the bounding rectangle of the preprocessed data

nodes.dat (export):
 * All nodes that have a matching type during preprocessing.

node.idx (export):
 * Index by numeric id over all nodes in 'nodes.dat'.

ways.dat (export):
 * All ways/areas that have a matching type during preprocessing.

way.idx (export):
 * Index by numeric id over all ways/areas in 'ways.dat'.

relations.dat (export):
 * All relations that have a matching type during preprocessing.
 * For all relations of type multipolygon members have been
   merged by type.

relation.idx (export):
 * Index by numeric id over all relations in 'relations.dat'.

area.idx (export):
 * Area index returning all ways/areas in a given bounding box
   that are of a given list of types and (for areas) have at least
   a given size.

areanode.idx (export):
 * Area index returning all nodes in a given bounding box
   that are of a given list of types and.

region.dat (export):
 * Holds the tree of areas that build up the hierachical
   administrative regions.

nameregion.idx (export):
 * Index on top of region.dat to look up administrative
   areas (e.g. cities) and indexed objects within these areas
   (e.g. streets).

water.idx (export, unfinished):
  * Index that for a given region returns tiles that are either
    of ground type 'water' or of ground type 'land' or ground type
    'both'. This will in future allow to correctly use the correct
    background color.
