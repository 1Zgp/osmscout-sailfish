This document list the files that are processed as part of an import.
For each file its content is described. Later version of this document
should also describe the internal format of each of these files. The
text in the brackets after the files name give information if this file
is required during import only ("import only") or are also part of the
official export data ("export").


rawnodes.dat (import only):
 * Raw dump of all nodes in import data

rawnode.idx (import only):
 * Index by numeric id over all nodes in 'rawnodes.dat'. Required
   for resolving nodes during way/area and relation preprocessing.

rawways.dat (import only):
 * Raw dump of all ways and areas in import data

rawway.idx (import only):
 * Index by numeric id over all ways/areas in 'rawways.dat'.
   Required for resolving nodes during relation preprocessing.

rawrels.dat (import only):
 * Raw dump of all relations in import data

rawcoastline.dat (import only):
* List of coastlines as parsed from import file

rawturnrestr.dat (import only):
 * List of restrictions as parsed from rawrels.dat

turnrestr.dat (import only):
 * List of restrictions modified by the Way data generator
   because of way merges.

wayblack.dat (import only):
 * List of way ids that are already part of a outer member
   of a multipolygon region. This ids will not be part of
   area.idx, because they would then be drawn twice. Once as way
   and once as part of the relation.

types.dat (export):
 * Mapping of internal type ids to type names
 * Mapping of internal tag ids to tag names

bounding.dat(export):
 * Holds the bounding rectangle of the preprocessed data

nodes.dat (export):
 * All nodes that have a matching type during preprocessing.

node.idmap (debug only):
 * Maps node ids to file offset. Only used for debugging using DumpData.

ways.dat (export):
 * All ways/areas that have a matching type during preprocessing.

way.idmap (debug only):
 * Maps way ids to file offset. Only used for debugging using DumpData.

relations.dat (export):
 * All relations that have a matching type during preprocessing.
 * For all relations of type multipolygon members have been
   merged by type.

relation.idmap (debug only):
 * Maps relation ids to file offset. Only used for debugging using DumpData.

areaarea.idx (export):
 * Area index returning all areas in a given bounding box
   that are of a given list of types and have at least
   a given size.

areaway.idx (export):
 * Area index returning all ways in a given bounding box
   that are of a given list of types.

areanode.idx (export):
 * Area index returning all nodes in a given bounding box
   that are of a given list of types and.

region.dat (export):
* Holds the tree of areas that build up the hierachical
   administrative regions.

nameregion.idx (export):
 * Index on top of region.dat to look up administrative
   areas (e.g. cities) and indexed objects within these areas
   (e.g. streets).

water.idx (export):
 * Index that for a given region returns tiles that are either
   of ground type 'water' or of ground type 'land' or ground type
   'coast'. Tiles of type coast also hold information about
   coastline within the tile and land regions within the tile.

optimized.dat (export)
 * Combined index and data file for returning (in the map.ost
   marked) ways in low zoom. Ways are merged and nodes are reduced
   to minimize the amount of data to load and render.

route.dat (export)
 * Contains the route graph.

route.idx (export)
 * Contains the index over the route graph to load individual
   routing nodes by id.
