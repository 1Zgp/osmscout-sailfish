# TODO

- **Submit to Jolla harbour store**
  Fit final rpm package to all harbour rules. 
  I want to create first OSM Scout release to harbour 
  as soon as possible. Future project direction can
  be updated on users needs...
    
- **Move animations**
  Movements should be more natural. If user swipe on map, 
  movement should have momentum.

- **Detect tap, double tap and hold gestures**
  I plan to show upper toolbar after tap, 
  zoom in after double tap and display place details after 
  "hold gesture".
  
## Long term todos

- **Optimise lib memory usage**
  -- Can be FeatureValueBuffer optimized? Can be global shared std::map better?
  -- Can be optimized memory usage in Area::Read ?

- **Map style setting**
- **Offline map manager**
- **POI and plase searching**
- **Management of favourite places**
- **Navigation**
