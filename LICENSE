To enable people to use and write applications based on libosmscout
on the various mobile devices technically supported and publish the resulting
apps to the platform app shops, the following exceptions /
clarifications have been given:

1. Making modifications to libosmscout configuration files, build scripts
   and configuration headers in order to create a customised build setup
   of libosmscout with the otherwise unmodified source code, does not
   constitute a derived work.
2. Building against libosmscout headers which have inlined code does not
   constitute a derived work.
3. Code which subclasses libosmscout classes outside of the libosmscout
   libraries does not form a derived work.
4. Statically linking the libosmscout libraries into a user application
   distributed on the Apple App Store or Apple Mac App Store does not make
   the user application a derived work.
5. Using source code obsfucation on the libosmscout source code when
   distributing it is not permitted.
